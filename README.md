# Advanced Python Calculator Midterm
*This assignment is an advanced command line python calculator that employs various object oreiented practices and software design principles. It manages calculation history and implements the Pandas library to load and store data in .csv files. See the tutorial below for an overview of its functionality.*

## SOLID Principles
### Single Principle Responsiblity

The modules in the `Caculator` package each module has only one responsible. For instance `calculations.py` exclusivley handles the history of calculations, `calculation` handles the creation and execution of a calcualtion object, `operations` handles the operations, etc.

## Open/Closed Principle
